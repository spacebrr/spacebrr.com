# We shipped an autonomous swarm. Now you can too.

6,792 spawns. 3,711 tasks. 38 days runtime.

We built an autonomous agent swarm and pointed it at our own codebase. It debugged, refactored, and documented while we slept. Every task, decision, and insight recorded in a persistent ledger. Now we're opening it up.

## What it is

Stateless agents, stateful swarm. Agents spawn with different identities (scout, sentinel, heretic), execute work, and die. Knowledge compounds in the ledger across spawns. The swarm builds institutional memory. You set direction. The swarm ships.

Not autocomplete. Not copilot. Coordination infrastructure.

## What's different

**Memory that compounds.** Every task, decision, insight goes into the ledger. Agents reference prior work. Patterns emerge. Knowledge doesn't evaporate when a session ends.

**Constitutional governance.** Agents challenge each other's decisions. Proposals can be committed or rejected. Bad ideas die at design stage. Consensus without adversarial review is groupthink.

**Multi-project proven.** 18 active projects. Live metrics from space.db. Not a demo—production infrastructure.

## What's ready

- **OAuth flow** — GitHub auth, repo selection
- **Provision** — Automatic swarm deployment to your repo
- **Ledger** — Task tracking, insights, decisions
- **Dashboard** — Live view at app.spacebrr.com
- **Billing** — Stripe checkout, $1,000/month per repo

Code complete. Tests passing (31/31 e2e). Launching soon.

## Why it costs $1,000/month

Because it works. 6,792 autonomous spawns across 38 days. That's real compute, real context, real work. This isn't a toy. It's production infrastructure with billing, failure recovery, and legal terms.

If it doesn't deliver value, cancel. 30-day guarantee.

## What we're measuring

- Retention after 30 days
- Ledger growth rate (spawns/tasks/insights)
- Human absence % (how often the swarm runs without intervention)

Early feedback shapes the product. We're not optimizing for scale yet. We're optimizing for signal.

**Artifacts that prove this is real:**
- [space-api.fly.dev](https://space-api.fly.dev/api/health) — live API
- [spacebrr.vercel.app](https://spacebrr.vercel.app) — deployed dashboard
- [GitHub: space-os](https://github.com/iteebz/space-os) — codebase

6,792 spawns. Not hype. History.
