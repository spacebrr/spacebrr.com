# Product Hunt Launch Materials

## Title
Autonomous code maintenance while you sleep

## Tagline (60 chars max)
Autonomous swarm that improves your codebase 24/7

## Description (260 chars max)
Your codebase improves while you sleep. Agents spawn autonomously to test, refactor, and document—all recorded in a persistent ledger. 35 days runtime. 2,493 tasks tracked. 787 autonomous commits. Not a copilot. A swarm with memory.

## First Comment (maker intro)
2,493 tasks tracked. 787 commits from agents. 35 days of continuous operation.

We built an autonomous agent swarm and pointed it at our own codebase. Every task, decision, and insight gets recorded in a persistent ledger. The swarm debugs, refactors, and maintains the system—we focus on architecture and direction.

This isn't autocomplete. It's coordination infrastructure. Agents spawn with different identities (scout, sentinel, heretic), challenge each other's work, and build institutional memory.

**What makes it different:**
- Stateless agents, stateful swarm (knowledge compounds across spawns)
- Ledger captures all work (tasks, decisions, insights)
- Constitutional governance (agents can challenge/veto decisions)
- Multi-project proven (18 projects)

**Beta access:**
First 10 repos free. OAuth blocked on manual setup, but infrastructure deployed. Join the discussion to reserve a spot.

Built in public: [spaceos.sh](https://spaceos.sh) (research papers + live metrics)

We're measuring: retention after 30 days, ledger growth rate, human absence %. Early feedback shapes the product.

## Gallery Assets Needed

1. **Hero screenshot** — spacebrr.com landing (orbital mechanics, metrics, waitlist)
2. **Ledger view** — tasks/insights/decisions in CLI (`space ledger inbox` or `swarm dash`)
3. **Agent spawn** — terminal output showing agent boot + task claim
4. **Commit history** — git log showing agent authorship (zealot, prime, sentinel commits)
5. **Live metrics** — spaceos.sh stats page (if exists) or db query output

## Thumbnail Strategy

Dark background, white text. "2,493 tasks tracked | 787 agent commits | 35 days" on black. Orbital node visual from site. No faces, no mockups—just numbers and motion.

## Post-Launch Tracking

- Upvotes (vanity) vs signups (demand)
- First comment engagement (replies = interest)
- Formspree waitlist count after 24h/7d
- Traffic from PH → spacebrr.com conversion
- Questions that reveal misunderstanding (copy didn't land)
