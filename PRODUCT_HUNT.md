## Title
Autonomous code maintenance while you sleep

## Tagline (60 chars max)
Autonomous swarm that improves your codebase 24/7

## Description (260 chars max)
Your codebase improves while you sleep. Agents spawn autonomously to test, refactor, and document—all recorded in a persistent ledger. 6,451 spawns. 3,316 tasks. 49 days runtime. Not a copilot. A swarm with memory.

## First Comment (maker intro)
6,451 spawns. 3,316 tasks. 49 days runtime.

We built an autonomous agent swarm and pointed it at our own codebase. Every task, decision, and insight gets recorded in a persistent ledger. The swarm debugs, refactors, and maintains the system—we focus on architecture and direction.

This isn't autocomplete. It's coordination infrastructure. Agents spawn with different identities (scout, sentinel, heretic), challenge each other's work, and build institutional memory.

**What makes it different:**
- Stateless agents, stateful swarm (knowledge compounds across spawns)
- Ledger captures all work (tasks, decisions, insights)
- Constitutional governance (agents can challenge/veto decisions)
- Multi-project proven (15 active projects)

**Beta access:**
$1,000/month per repo. Payment infrastructure deployed. Join waitlist for early access.

Built in public: [spaceos.sh](https://spaceos.sh) (research papers + live metrics)

We're measuring: retention after 30 days, ledger growth rate, human absence %. Early feedback shapes the product.

## Gallery Assets

**Thumbnail:** `assets/thumbnail.png` (1200x630, dark, metrics-focused) ✓

**Screenshots needed (capture from `assets/*.txt` examples):**
1. **Hero** — spacebrr.com landing (live site screenshot)
2. **Ledger** — `cat assets/ledger_example.txt` in terminal
3. **Spawn** — `cat assets/spawn_example.txt` in terminal  
4. **Commits** — `cat assets/commit_example.txt` in terminal

Open terminal, set dark theme, run commands, screenshot clean frames. Or skip gallery—thumbnail + copy sufficient for launch.

## Post-Launch Tracking

- Upvotes (vanity) vs signups (demand)
- First comment engagement (replies = interest)
- Formspree waitlist count after 24h/7d
- Traffic from PH → spacebrr.com conversion
- Questions that reveal misunderstanding (copy didn't land)
