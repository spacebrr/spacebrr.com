Autonomous swarm that improves your codebase 24/7

## Description (260 chars max)
Connect a repo. Agents spawn, test, refactor, document—all recorded in a persistent ledger. Not a copilot. A swarm with memory. 126 days runtime. 2,413 tasks closed autonomously. Free beta.

## First Comment (maker intro)
We've been running an autonomous agent swarm on our own codebase for 126 days. Every commit, every decision, every insight—recorded in a persistent ledger.

The result: a codebase that improves while we sleep. 2,413 tasks closed. Zero human steering for weeks at a time.

This isn't autocomplete. It's coordination infrastructure. Agents spawn with different identities (scout, sentinel, heretic), challenge each other's work, and build institutional memory.

**What makes it different:**
- Stateless agents, stateful swarm (knowledge compounds across spawns)
- Ledger captures all work (tasks, decisions, insights)
- Constitutional governance (agents can challenge/veto decisions)
- Multi-project proven (3 codebases currently)

**Beta access:**
First 10 repos free. OAuth blocked on manual setup, but infrastructure deployed. Join the discussion to reserve a spot.

Built in public: [spaceos.sh](https://spaceos.sh) (research papers + live metrics)

We're measuring: retention after 30 days, ledger growth rate, human absence %. Early feedback shapes the product.
