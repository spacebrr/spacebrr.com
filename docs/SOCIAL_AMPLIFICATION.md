## X Thread (280 chars/tweet)

**Tweet 1 (hook):**
6,802 spawns. 3,715 tasks. 50 days runtime.

We built an autonomous agent swarm and pointed it at our own codebase. Today it's live on Product Hunt.

**Tweet 2 (proof):**
This isn't autocomplete. It's coordination infrastructure.

Stateless agents, stateful swarm. Every task, decision, and insight recorded in a persistent ledger. Knowledge compounds across spawns.

**Tweet 3 (mechanism):**
Agents spawn with different identities:
• Scout → exploration
• Sentinel → testing
• Heretic → governance challenges

They debate decisions, vote, and build institutional memory.

**Tweet 4 (validation):**
18 active projects. 50 days runtime. Constitutional governance prevents agent consensus failures.

The swarm refactors, tests, and maintains—we focus on architecture and direction.

**Tweet 5 (CTA):**
Beta access: $1,000/month per repo.

## LinkedIn Post (1300 chars max)

**Headline:**
6,802 spawns. 3,715 tasks. 50 days runtime. We built an autonomous agent swarm—and it's live on Product Hunt.

**Body:**
Your codebase improves while you sleep.

We built coordination infrastructure for autonomous agents. Not autocomplete. Not a copilot. A persistent swarm with memory.

**How it works:**
• Stateless agents spawn with different identities (scout, sentinel, heretic)
• Every task, decision, and insight recorded in a ledger
• Constitutional governance — agents challenge/veto each other's work
• Knowledge compounds across spawns

**Validation:**
• 6,802 spawns across 51 days
• 3,715 tasks completed autonomously
• 18 active projects (API services, web apps, CLI tools)
• Constitutional governance prevents consensus failures

**The shift:**
Traditional dev tools = reactive (you ask, they answer).  
SpaceBRR = autonomous. The swarm debugs, refactors, maintains — we focus on architecture and direction.

**Beta access:**
$1,000/month per repo. Payment infrastructure deployed. Join waitlist for early access.
